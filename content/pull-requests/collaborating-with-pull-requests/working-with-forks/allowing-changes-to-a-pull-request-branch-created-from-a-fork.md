You can set commit permissions when you first create a pull request from a fork. For more information, see "[Creating a pull request from a fork](/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)." Additionally, you can modify an existing pull request to let repository maintainers make commits to your branch.

## Enabling repository maintainer permissions on existing pull requests

2. Under the upstream repository name, click {% octicon "git-pull-request" aria-label="The pull request icon" %} **Pull requests**.
